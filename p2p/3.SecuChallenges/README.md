## Step 0 - Setup

First, you have to download [MetaMask Plugin](https://metamask.io/download.html), and create an ethereum account.
Then, you can claim some Rinkeby faucet [here](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet).
You will use it to solve the following challenges, but it does not have a real value ; it is often use for testing purposes.

## Step 1 - Easy Level

In this category, you will learn the very basics of Ethereum Smart Contracts, Solidity syntax language and how to use you web3JS
console. To access it, open `Inspect Element` on your browser and click on the `Console` tab.

To understand the syntax of Solidity language, you can have some ressources [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_basic_syntax.htm).

### 1.0 [Hello Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x4E73b858fD5D7A5fc1c3455061dE52a53F35d966)

The first challenge has the purpose to introduce you to the utils you're going to need to solve the challenges on ethernaut.

### 1.1 [Fallback](https://ropsten.ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xe2F72aa61fD6322C6c4d22227a594391E051F990)

This challenge introduce you to the fallback security breach, and learn good practices for your futures smart contracts!

### 1.2 [Coin Flip](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x4dF32584890A0026e56f7535d0f2C6486753624f)

It's going to introduce you to the basic random number generator security breach.

## Step 2 - Medium Level

### 2.0 [Gatekeeper One](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x9b261b23cE149422DE75907C6ac0C30cEc4e652A)

This challenge will introduce you to the gasleft function and the conversion between types.

### 2.1 [Force](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x22699e6AdD7159C3C385bf4d7e1C647ddB3a99ea)

For this challenge, you're going to need a lot of perseverance and a it's going to help you understand a bit more the complex smart contracts.

### 2.2 [Vault](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xf94b476063B6379A3c8b6C836efB8B3e10eDe188)

This challenge will introduce you to how the variables are stored in the etherum blockchain.

## Step 3 - Hard Level

Thoses challenges will help you understand how bigger contracts and flashloan works and how there might be an exploit in it.

### 3.0 [The rewarder](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/5.html)
